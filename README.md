## Skills

- **Data Tranformation (ETL) with Power Query**: Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
- **DAX Measures & Calculations**: Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like Median Yearly Salary and Job Count.
- **Core Charts**: Utilised Column, Bar, Line and Area Charts to compare job counts and track trends over time.
- **KPI Indicators & Tables**: Used Cards to display key metrics and Tables to provide granualr, sortable data.
- **Dashboard Design**: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting**:
  - **Slicers**: To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
  - **Buttons & Bookmarks**: To create a seamless navigation experience for the users.
  - **Drill-Through**: To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview

### Page 1: High-Level Market View

This page provides a high-level overview of the 2024 data job market. It provides an overview of job demand, salary benchmarks and job role distribution to quickly help the user. Essential insights include job posting totals, annual and hourly median salaries, job trend over time, and demand comparison across main data roles. This view helps quickly assess the market prior to examining the role details.

### Page 2: Job Title Drill-Through

This page provides a detailed view for a selected job title, accessed via drill-through from the main dashboard. It allows users to analyse role-specific characteristics such as salary distribution, work-from-home availability, degree requirements, hiring platforms, and geographic job locations. The drill-through design enables deeper analysis while keeping the main dashboard uncluttered, supporting both high-level exploration and focused role analysis.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates how raw job market data can be transformed into an interactive dashboard that allows for a high-level market understanding as well as detailed role analysis. This dashboard allows users to slice, filter, and drill-through data to make informed decisions about their career paths. While delivering this project I enhanced my skills in data transformation, DAX calculations, and Report designing on Power BI, focusing on usability and storytelling. The approach demonstrates how dashboards are used in business for decision-making not for data display only.
