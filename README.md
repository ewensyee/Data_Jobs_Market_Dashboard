## About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my Power BI projects focused on data analysis, reporting, and dashboard design. The dashboards demonstrate how raw datasets can be transformed into clear, interactive reports that support insight discovery and decision-making. The portfolio highlights my progression from foundational Power BI concepts to more advanced techniques, including data modelling, DAX calculations, and user-focused dashboard design. Each project includes a dedicated README that explains the analytical approach, design decisions, and key insights. These projects reflect how I approach analytics in practice: starting with clean, reliable data, designing with the end user in mind, and prioritising clarity over complexity.
